Before you run,

1. The codes are wrappered in corresponding class. The driver code is in the main_test_demo.py.
2. To run the test run in terminal: python main_test_demo [filename] [capacity] [task]
Yes, I added a new sys arg to specify the certain task in part2. 
task = 0 would mean to calculate all roughness, curvature and the maximal points, write them into files and visualize them.
task = 1 would mean to calculate roughness and curvature write them into files and visualize them.
task = 2 would mean to calculate the maximum points, write them into files and visualize them.
